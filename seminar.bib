  abstract = {In typical classification tasks, we seek a function which assigns a label to a single
object. Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs),
which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of
choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to
use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees.
However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured
data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore
structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing
much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such
as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting
problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack
strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new
framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin
Markov (M3
) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with
high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured
data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3
networks based on a
compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound
for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten
character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very
significant gains over previous approaches.},

natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity

engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made
input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the
basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for
building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.},

classifies navigable and non-navigable regions on those maps
using Hidden Markov models. The maps generated by our
approach can be used for path planning, navigation, local
obstacle avoidance, detection of changes in the terrain, and object
recognition. We propose a map segmentation algorithm based
on Markov Random Fields, which removes small errors in the
classification. In order to validate our algorithms, we present
experimental results using two robotic platforms.},
