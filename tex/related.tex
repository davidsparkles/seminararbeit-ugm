TODO: Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems:Networks of Plausible Inference" written by Judea Pearl, chapter 3: Markov and Bayesian Networks:Two Graphical Representations of Probabilistic Knowledge, p.116:
The main weakness of Markov networks is their inability to represent induced and non-transitive dependencies; two independent variables will be directly connected by an edge, merely because some other variable depends on both. As a result, many useful independencies go unrepresented in the network. To overcome this deficiency, Bayesian networks use the richer language of directed graphs, where the directions of the arrows permit us to distinguish genuine dependencies from spurious dependencies induced by hypothetical observations.
