TODO:  Why is it important? What are the core challenges? How is this problem solved?

Directed probabilistic graphical models can represent many real-world problems. But there are some problems, which cannot be addressed by directed but by undirected graphical models. In addition to that undirected graphs might also be easier to understand and might represent a problem in an easier way.

A core advantage of undirected graphs for probabilistic modeling over for example a Bayesian network (as common directed graphical model) is the property that undirected graphs are capable of representing cycles. For example if the impact of four planets on each other in terms of gravity should be modeled there is neither a starting nor a target point of dependency among those four planets. The acceleration of each planet mainly depends on the gravity fields of the three other planets (and the distance). Using undirected graphical models it is possible to represent such cyclic dependencies.
