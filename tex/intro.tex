I will mainly refer to the insights described in \cite{koller2009probabilistic}.

Include (or understand) more of the main book \cite{koller2009probabilistic}. Partially Directed Models, Markov network independences parameterization revisited, bayesian networks and markov networks, summary and discussion

- what is a graphical mode?
 + a framework
 + as representation of (1) set of independencies and (2) sekleton for factorizing a distribution
 + a declarative representation that is a 'reasonable encoding of our world'
 + representation, inference, learning, see chapter 1.2.2
- Why graphical models?
 + model dependencies and random variables in a nice way
 + full joint distribution has much more values which are not necessary always needed (e.g. Markov blanket) 'which provides a mechanism for
exploiting structure in complex distributions to describe them compactly, and in a way that
allows them to be constructed and utilized effectively' \cite{koller2009probabilistic}
