I will mainly refer to the insights described in \cite{koller2009probabilistic}.

Include (or understand) more of the main book \cite{koller2009probabilistic}. Partially Directed Models, Markov network independences parameterization revisited, bayesian networks and markov networks, summary and discussion

- what is a graphical mode?
 + a framework
 + as representation of (1) set of independencies and (2) sekleton for factorizing a distribution
 + a declarative representation that is a 'reasonable encoding of our world'
 + representation, inference, learning, see chapter 1.2.2

- short outline
 - first shot motivation why we want to do this and problem statement \ref{sec:motivation}
 - in section \ref{sec:methodology} first the essential fundamentals in form of the probability and graph theory as described, followed by how to represent a probabilistic model in a undirected graphical model, which leads to some selected possibilities of how inference and learning on those models works
